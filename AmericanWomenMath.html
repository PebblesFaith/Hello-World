        <p>
                Welcome to my famous International Women Mathematicians tutorial website, I have created, the
                International Women Mathematicians website to provide historical and informative biographical
                and factual information and about International Women Mathematicians who have contribute their
                intelligentsia to apply mathematical science applications.  In the month of March 2019, I have
                chosen three (3) outstanding International Women Mathematicians who are selected for my tutorial
                website are, as follows:

                 <ol>
                     <li>Christine Darden</li>
                     <li>Ada Lovelace</li>
                     <li>Sevtlana Jitomirskaya</li>
                 </ol>

                <p>Dr. Christine Darden is an American mathematician, data analyst, and aeronautical engineer
                who devoted much of her 40-year career in aerodynamics at NASA to researching supersonic 
                flight and sonic booms.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Christine Darden (born September 10, 1942, as Christine Mann) is an American mathematician,
                            data analyst, and aeronautical engineer who devoted much of her 40-year career in aerodynamics 
                            at NASA to researching supersonic flight and sonic booms. She had an M.S. in mathematics and had
                            been teaching at Virginia State University before starting to work at the Langley Research Center
                            in 1967. She earned a PhD in engineering at George Washington University in 1983 and has published
                            numerous articles in her field. She was the first African-American woman at NASA's Langley Research
                            Center to be promoted into the Senior Executive Service, the top rank in the federal civil service.

                <h5><em>Field: Not Applicable</em></h5>
                
                <h5><em>Known for: Mathematicians and Computing</em></h5>
                        
                <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known
                   for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical 
                   Engine. </p>

                        <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was
                        an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed
                        mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that
                        the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended 
                        to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise 
                        the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.

                <p>Svetlana Yakovlevna Jitomirskaya is a Soviet-American mathematician working on dynamical 
                   systems and mathematical physics. Jitomirskaya was born in Kharkiv. Both her mother, Valentina
                   Borok, and her father Yakov Zhitomirskii were professors of mathematics.

                    <h5><em>Career Path</em></h5>
                        <p>Her undergraduate studies were at Moscow State University, where she was a student of, among
                        others, Vladimir Arnold and Yakov Sinai.[1] She obtained her Ph.D. from Moscow State University
                        in 1991 under the supervision of Yakov Sinai.[3] She joined the mathematics department at the
                        University of California, Irvine in 1991 as a lecturer, and became an assistant professor there
                        in 1994 and a full professor in 2000.[2] She is best known for solving the ten martini problem 
                        along with mathematician Artur Avila.
